### Why Maternal Mortality Matters

Maternal mortality refers to the death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth, or within the postpartum period. It is not just a statisticâ€”it represents significant challenges related to healthcare access, social inequality, and gender equity.

Reducing maternal mortality is crucial for the wellbeing of families and communities. It is also a key indicator of the overall quality of healthcare systems and public health policies.

st.write("""
High maternal mortality rates often highlight systemic issues in healthcare and education. By examining trends and comparing data across regions, we can identify areas for targeted improvement and policy change.
