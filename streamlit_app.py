### Why Maternal Mortality Matters

Maternal mortality refers to the death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth, or within the postpartum period. It is not just a statisticâ€”it represents the significant challenges many countries face regarding access to quality healthcare, social inequality, and gender equity.

Reducing maternal mortality is a crucial goal for ensuring the wellbeing of families and communities. It is a key indicator of the overall quality of healthcare systems, public health policies, and societal development.
