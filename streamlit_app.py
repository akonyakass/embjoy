    ## Understanding Maternal Mortality

    Maternal mortality refers to the death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of delivery due to complications.
    It is a critical indicator of the quality of healthcare systems, social equity, and overall socioeconomic development.

    ### Why Is This Issue Critical?

    - **Human Rights and Equity:**  
      Each maternal death exposes systemic issues in accessing quality healthcare and education.
      
    - **Economic and Social Impact:**  
      High maternal mortality rates disrupt families and burden communities with long-term economic and social challenges.
      
    - **Healthcare Quality Indicator:**  
      It reflects a nation's capacity to provide effective prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care.

    Addressing maternal mortality requires targeted interventions, policy reforms, and a strong commitment to enhancing health services.
