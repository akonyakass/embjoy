## Understanding Maternal Mortality

Maternal mortality refers to the death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of delivery due to complications. It is a critical indicator of the quality of healthcare systems, social equity, and socioeconomic development.

### Why Is This Issue Critical?

- **Human Rights and Equity:**  
  Each maternal death reveals systemic challenges in healthcare access and education.
  
- **Economic and Social Impact:**  
  High maternal mortality disrupts families and burdens communities with long-term economic and social challenges.
  
- **Indicator of Healthcare Quality:**  
  It measures a nation's ability to provide adequate prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care.
  
Addressing maternal mortality requires targeted interventions, policy reforms, and an unwavering commitment to improving health services.
